I think I'm going to do my project using the hangman game.

- As a user I should be able to enter my own word or phrase
- As a user I should be able to see all the available alphabet letters
- As a user I should see the letters guess change so I know what was guessed and left to guess
- As a user I should see how many wins and how many losses
- As a user I can click a button and generate a word for me to guess
- As a user I should start the game with 10 lives.

Bronze Level:
- Basic count return of bad guesses and set limit to how many tries
- Basic buttons
- Instructions: Use the alphabet below to guess the word

Silver Level:
- Cool Picture
- Basic Scoring

Gold Level:
- Words to guess could be pulled from a list
- Words list could come from an api database
- Filter random words by category
- click a button to offer hints, but they count against the player
